# Food-Order-App
This is a simple react app that enacts the process of managing a food ordering system that helps manage a cart system calculating the total amount and the list of added items.

To run the application, download all the files in the FoodApp folder.
After navigating to the downloaded app folder through the terminal, run *npm-install* to install all the dependencies in package.json attached with the app.

After the installation finishes, run *npm start* to start the application server which can then be accessed through *localhost:3000*.

# This is the starting UI screen of the application.
